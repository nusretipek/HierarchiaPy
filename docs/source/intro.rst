Introduction
============

Dominance and hierarchy is one of the core concepts in the research field of animal social behaviour. The hierarchy (dominance) can be derived from the interactions between the individuals (dyadic relationships). There are numerous techniques to derive the dominance from such dataset. We can classify them into two categories; numerical matrix optimizzation for certain criteria which results in a rank order (1) and calculation of a certain dominance measure for each individual from which a rank can be computed (1).

The **HierarchiaPy** statistical python package aims to implement available methods from both categories, allowing the animal social scientists to derive dominance efficiently, easily and in a reproducible way.
